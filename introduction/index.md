## Introduction

Our assetic filters are a (growing) list of filters which enhance Assetic and can make your job easier as a developer, meaning you can get home earlier. Good, right?

We currently have the following filters:

1. [SASS PHP Compiler](#sass-php-compiler)
2. [LESS PHP Compiler](#less-php-compiler)
