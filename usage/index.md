## Usage

### SASS PHP Compiler

Like the logic behind CoffeeScript, we would like people to get up and running with the predecessor to [SCSS, known as SASS](http://sass-lang.com) with ease. Rather than install a ruby gem, simply pass an instance of `Cartalyst\AsseticFilters\SassphpFilter` to your assetic filters and you're done.

### LESS PHP Compiler

Like the logic behind CoffeeScript, we would like people to get up and running with [LESS](http://lesscss.org) with ease. Rather than install a ruby gem, simply pass an instance of `Cartalyst\AsseticFilters\LessphpFilter` to your assetic filters and you're done.
